LilyGO T-Deck 18650 enclosure

This enclosure can sit in a window charging the batteries either via solar or USB. It charges battery 1 first, then when bat1 is full, it charges battery 2, and eventually battery 3. Any of the 3 batteries can power the TDeck. It can operate with no batteries as long as USB is providing power. The circuit board includes
- over and under voltage protection
- short circuit protection 
- multi stage charging
- battery temperature protection
- charging via solar or USB
